# SimpleHallDisplay

Very simple hall-effect sensor display.

Uses a generic chinese hall sensor board with [49E Hall-Effect Linear Position Sensor (datasheet)](assets/K1139513440.pdf)

The value is shown on a cheap chinese ssd1306 display with a "calculated gauss value" and raw value from the sensor and a guess on which pole is near the sensor.
