# SimpleHallDisplay

Very simple hall sensor display

Uses a generic chinese hall sensor board with 49E https://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/SPEC/440/K1139513440.pdf and lm393 as a buffer (should work directly with the sensor also, but this is what I had in my parts bin :)

The value is shown on a cheap chinese ssd1306 display with a "calculated gauss value" and raw value from the sensor and a guess on which pole is near the sensor.
